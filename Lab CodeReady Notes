# Install all your environment tools including Podman and runtime
sudo yum module install container-tools

# podman images is a non-root command
# podman ps just shows running containers, whereas podman ps -a shows all containers (running and used to run)
# system containers starts a service and then waits until you tell it to stop
# podman logs containername to analyze if a container needs additional env variables

# ConfigMaps allow a better way to run with env variables

# man <command>
# man /examples

# To find operating system
cat /etc/os-release 
# To find kernel
uname -r
