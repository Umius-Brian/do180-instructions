# Install all your environment tools including Podman and runtime
sudo yum module install container-tools

# podman images is a non-root command
# podman ps just shows running containers, whereas podman ps -a shows all containers (running and used to run)
# system containers starts a service and then waits until you tell it to stop
# podman logs containername to analyze if a container needs additional env variables

# ConfigMaps allow a better way to run with env variables

# man <command>
man -k podman
# man /examples
man podman-run

# To find operating system
cat /etc/os-release 
# To find kernel
uname -r

# Use podman inspect frequently to learn more about images

# To list more details about images
podman search --no-trunc ubi8

# To list details about an image before pulling it
skopeo inspect docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal

# To list details on disk about an image 
podman image inspect <image_id>

# Make a backup copy
podman save -o myimage.tar <image_id>
ls -l (to show image in local files)

# Rootless containers do not get an IP address, cannot bind to privileged ports, and have limited access to fs
# Default in OpenShift
