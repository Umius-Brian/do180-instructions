Objectives:
  - Deploy a MySQL database pod on OpenShift using oc new-app

[student@workstation ~]$ lab openshift-resources start

# Load the env created in the first exercise
[student@workstation ~]$ source /usr/local/etc/ocp4.config

# Login to the OpenShift cluster
[student@workstation ~]$ oc login -u ${RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER} -p \
> ${RHT_OCP4_DEV_PASSWORD} ${RHT_OCP4_MASTER_API}

# Create a new project that contains your RHOCP dev username for the resources you create during this exercise
[student@workstation ~]$ oc new-project ${RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER}-mysql-openshift

# Create a new app using the mysql-persistent template using the oc-app command
# Image requires using -p for env
# Use --template option with the oc new-app command to specify a template with persistent storage so that OpenShift does not pull an image from the internet
[student@workstation ~]$ oc new-app \
> --template=mysql-persistent \
> -p MYSQL_USER=user1 -p MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypa55 -p MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb \
> -p MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=r00tpa55 -p VOLUME_CAPACITY=10Gi

# Verify the pod details and service, and that the image deployment was successful
[student@workstation ~]$ oc status

# List the pods to verify that the MySQL pod is running
[student@workstation ~]$ oc get pods
# mysql-1-5vfn4    1/1     Running     0          109s

# Get more pod details
[student@workstation ~]$ oc describe pod mysql-1-5vfn4

# List the services in this project and verify that the service to access the MySQL pod was created
[student@workstation ~]$ oc get svc

# Retrieve the details of the MySQL sservice and note that the service type is ClusterIP by default
[student@workstation ~]$ oc describe service mysql

# List the persistent storage claims in the project
[student@workstation ~]$ oc get pvc

# Retrieve details of the mysql pvc
[student@workstation ~]$ oc describe pvc/mysql

# Connect to the MySQL database server and verify that the database was created
# Configure port forwarding from the workstation machine and the database pod running on OpenShift using port 3306
# Terminal will hang after command execution
[student@workstation ~]$ oc port-forward mysql-1-5vfn4 3306:3306

# From the workstation terminal, open another terminal and connect to the MySQL server using the MySQL client
[student@workstation ~]$ mysql -uuser1 -pmypa55 --protocol tcp -h localhost

# Verify the creation of the database
mysql> show database;

# Exit
mysql> exit

# Close the terminal and return to the previous one
# Finish the port forwarding process by ctrl+C

# Delete the project to remove all resources
[student@workstation ~]$ oc delete project ${RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER}-mysql-openshift

[student@workstation ~]$ lab openshift-resource finish
