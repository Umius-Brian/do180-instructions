CREATE: creates ROL classroom and all VMs needed and starts them
DELETE: deletes ROL classroom to go back to original start
START: starts all VMs in classroom
OPEN CONSOLE: connects to console of VM
Start: Starts VM
Shutdown: Gracefully shuts down VM, preserving disk contents
Power Off: Forcefully shuts down VM, preserving disk contents
Reset: Forcefully shuts down VM, resets disk to initial state with all contents lost

Objectives:
  - Configure workstation to access OpenShift cluster, container image registry, and Git repo
  - Fork from course's sample app repo to personal GitHub, then clone from personal GitHub to workstation machine

# On workstation, execute git configcommand with credential.helper cache parameters to store in cache memory credentials for future use
[student@workstation ~]$ git config --global credential.helper cache
  # if prompted for a password while using Git operations on command line, use access token

# Open a terminal on workstation machine and execute this command (cmd-c to start over)
[student@workstation ~]$ lab-configure
# API Endpoint: https://api.cluster.domain.example.com:6443
# Username and password for OpenShift: 
# Line4/5: Personal GitHub and Quay account names
# Quay: brian_bui_ibm
# GitHub: umius-brian
# Brianisbest06!
# Run lab-configure again if not working
# If successful, ready to start exercises

# Fork course's sample apps into personal GitHub account
# Navigate to github.com/redhattraining/DO180-apps
# Click Fork on top-right corner and select your username
[student@workstation ~]$ git clone https://github.com/Umius-Brian/DO180-apps

# Verify that /home/user/DO180-apps is a Git repo
[student@workstation ~]$ cd DO180-apps
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ git status
# should say "On branch master, nothing to commit"

# Create a new branch to test new personal access token
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ git checkout -b testbranch
# "switched"

# Make a change to TEST file and commit to Git
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ echo "DO180" > TEST
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ git add .
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ git commit -am "DO180"

# Push changes to recently created testing branch
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ git push --set-upstream origin testbranch
# if prompted for username: enter GitHub username
# if prompted for password: enter access token

# Make another change and notice that you are no longer asked for username and password due to credential helper
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ echo "OCP4.6" > TEST
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ git add .
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ git commit -am "OCP4.6"
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ git push

# Verify that /home/user/DO180/apps contains this course's sample apps, then change back to user's home folder
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ head README.md
# "#DO180-apps"
[student@workstation DO180-apps]$ cd ~
[student@workstation ~]$

# There should be a local clone of DO180-apps repo on workstation machine

# All exercises that build apps from source start from master branch of DO180-apps Git repo. Exercises that make changes to source code requires making a new branch to host changes so that master contains a good starting point
