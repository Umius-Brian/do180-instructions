Objectives:
  - Run containers as root and rootless

[student@workstation ~]$ lab container-rootless start

# Run container as root user and check UID of a running process within it
# --rm is cleanup, meaning file system is removed when container exits (by default, all containers persist a file system but this can quickly accumulate)
[student@workstation ~]$ sudo podman run --rm --name asroot -ti \
> registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8:latest /bin/bash

[root@f95d16108991 /]# whoami
# root
[root@f95d16108991 /]# id
# uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

# Start a sleep process inside the container
[root@f95d16108991 /]# sleep 1000

# On a new terminal, run ps to search for the process
# ps -ef is used to find the PID of the process
[student@workstation ~]$ sudo ps -ef | grep "sleep 1000"
# root        3137    3117  0 10:18 pts/0    00:00:00 /usr/bin/coreutils --coreutils-prog-shebang=sleep /usr/bin/sleep 1000

# Exit the container
[root@f95d16108991 /]# sleep 1000
^C
[root@f95d16108991 /]# exit
[student@workstation ~]$

# Run the container as a regular user and check UID of a running process within it
# Start the container from a Red Hat UBI as a regular user
[student@workstation ~]$ podman run --rm --name asuser -ti \
> registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8:latest /bin/bash

[root@d289dccd5285 /]# whoami
# root
[root@d289dccd5285 /]# id
# uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

# Start a sleep process within the container
[root@d289dccd5285 /]# sleep 2000

# On a new terminal, run ps to search for the process
# grep -v grep takes input line by line and outputs only the lines that grep does not appear in
# Without -v, only lines where grep appears would output
[student@workstation ~]$ sudo ps -ef | grep "sleep 2000" | grep -v grep
# student     3345    3325  0 10:24 pts/0    00:00:00 /usr/bin/coreutils --coreutils-prog-shebang=sleep /usr/bin/sleep 2000

# Exit the container
[root@d289dccd5285 /]# sleep 2000
^C
[root@d289dccd5285 /]# exit
[student@workstation ~]$

# On a workstation machine, use the lab command to complete the exercise to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises
[student@workstation ~]$ lab container-rootless finish
