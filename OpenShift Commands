oc api-resources / kubectl api-resources        Obtain a list of all resources in a RHOCP cluster
oc expose           expose service for external access via OpenShift Routes
oc edit svc         edit service attributes and specify NodePort as value for type and provide port value for nodePort attributes
oc port-forward     forward a local port to a single pod port (only works locally, unlike a service which load balances multiple pods for all   network users)

oc new-app (-o json or -o yaml)       creates a skeleton resource definition file
oc new-app -h                         lists all available options for creating new apps
oc new-app                            can also create apps from Dockerfile or S2I
oc create -f <filename>               creates an app from the resource definition file or merged from other files to create a composite app
oc get (-o json or -o yaml)           export resource definition
oc get-all                            displays important resources in a cluster
oc describe <resource_type> <resource_name>           to retrieve additional info not found from get-all
oc edit                               edit resources from a resource definition (automatically opens a vi buffer)
oc delete                             removes a resource from a cluster (although pods will automatically restart so understand the OpenShift architecture)

oc exec <container_id>                executes commands from inside a container                               

oc get users

oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin <name>     give admin access to new user
