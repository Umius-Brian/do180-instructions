Objectives:
  - Use prebuilt container images to create and manage containerized services
  - Manage container lifecycle from creation to deletion
  - Save container app data to persistent storage
  - Use port forwarding to access container

# Podman allows you to run containers, run them in the background, execute new processes inside them, and provide them with resources (fs volumes, network)
