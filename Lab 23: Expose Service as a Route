Objectives:
  - Expose a deployed application's service as a route

[student@workstation ~]$ lab openshift-routes start

[student@workstation ~]$ source /usr/local/etc/ocp4.config

# Login to OpenShift cluster
[student@workstation ~]$ oc login -u ${RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER} -p \
> ${RHT_OCP4_DEV_PASSWORD} ${RHT_OCP4_MASTER_API}

# Create a new project that contains RHOCP dev username for the resources created
[student@workstation ~]$ oc new-project ${RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER}-route

# Create a new PHP application using the quay.io/redhattraining/php-hello-dockerfile image
[student@workstation ~]$ oc new-app \
> --docker-image=quay.io/redhattraining/php-hello-dockerfile \
> --name php-helloworld

# Monitoring the deployment progress
# -w means working directory
[student@workstation ~]$ oc get all
[student@workstation ~]$ oc get pods -w
# php-helloworld-74bb86f6cb-zt6wl   1/1     Running   0          5s
# ^C
# Alternatively monitor with oc logs -f php-helloworld-74bb86f6cb-zt6wl
# ^C

# Review the service
# Note the IP and namespace
[student@workstation ~]$ oc describe svc/php-helloworld

# Expose the service, which creates a route
# Use the default name and FQDN for the route
[student@workstation ~]$ oc expose svc/php-helloworld
[student@workstation ~]$ oc describe route

# Access the service from an external host to verify the service and route are working
[student@workstation ~]$ curl \
> php-helloworld-${RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER}-route.${RHT_OCP4_WILDCARD_DOMAIN}
# Hello, World! PHP version is 7.2.11 (may be different)

# Replace the route with one named xyz
# First, delete the current one (although this is optional because you can have multiple routes for the same service, provided they have different names)
[student@workstation ~]$ oc delete route/php-helloworld

# Create a route for the service with the name ${RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER}-xyz
[student@workstation ~]$ oc expose svc/php-helloworld \
> --name={RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER}-xyz
[student@workstation ~]$ oc describe route

# Make an HTTP request using the FQDN on port 80
[student@workstation ~]$ curl \
> ${RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER}-xyz-${RHT_OCP4_DEV_USER}-route.${RHT_OCP4_WILDCARD_DOMAIN}
# Hello, World! PHP version is 7.2.11
